# add open file button to context file ticks - Task Introduction

## Created: 2025-07-13
## Status: Completed

This is the main task node for: **add open file button to context file ticks**

### Task Overview
Add "Open" buttons next to each context file checkbox in the DevTreeFlow dashboard to allow users to open the context documents directly in VS Code. This will improve the user experience by providing quick access to view context files alongside the checkbox interface.

### Current Analysis
- Context files are displayed in the dashboard with checkboxes for selection
- The HTML is generated in `updateDashboardState` function around line 905-910 in `src/dashboard.ts`
- Need to add open file functionality via VS Code API

### Implementation Completed âœ…
1. âœ… Added CSS styling for the open file button (.context-file-open-btn, .context-file-row)
2. âœ… Modified HTML generation to include "Open" button next to each context file in a flexbox layout
3. âœ… Added JavaScript function `openContextFile()` to handle opening files
4. âœ… Added message handler `handleOpenContextFile()` in TypeScript to use VS Code API for opening files
5. âœ… Code compiled successfully without errors

### Changes Made
- **CSS**: Added styles for `.context-file-row`, `.context-file-open-btn` with hover effects
- **HTML**: Wrapped each context file in a div with checkbox and open button
- **JavaScript**: Added `openContextFile(filename)` function to send message to extension
- **TypeScript**: Added `handleOpenContextFile(filename)` method to open files via VS Code API

### How It Works
1. User clicks "ðŸ“„ Open" button next to any context file
2. JavaScript sends message to extension with filename
3. Extension resolves full path to ProjectSpecificContextFiles directory
4. VS Code opens the document in a new editor tab
5. Error handling for missing files with user-friendly messages

### Context Files
- Read parent instructions from: InstructionsFromParent/
- Document progress in: MeAndMyChildren/
