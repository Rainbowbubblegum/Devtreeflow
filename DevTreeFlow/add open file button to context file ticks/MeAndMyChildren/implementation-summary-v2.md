# Implementation Summary: Context Folder Management & AI Rules

## Features Implemented ✅

### 1. Hierarchical Folder Structure for Context Files
- **Recursive folder display** showing the complete directory tree
- **Visual hierarchy** with indented subfolders and files
- **Folder icons** (📁) and file icons (📄) for easy identification
- **Hover actions** that appear when you hover over items

### 2. Context Document Management
- **"New Folder" button** - Creates folders at any level in the hierarchy
- **"New Document" button** - Creates context documents with a helpful template
- **Folder-specific actions** - Add subfolders or documents to any folder
- **Auto-refresh** - Updates the view after creating folders/documents

### 3. Enhanced File Operations
- **Checkbox selection** - Works with the new folder structure
- **Open buttons** - Quick access to view any context document
- **Path preservation** - Maintains full relative paths for nested files

### 4. Context Document Template
When creating new context documents, they're initialized with:
```markdown
# [Document Name]

## Context Overview
[Describe what this context document provides]

## Guidelines
- [Add specific guidelines here]

## Instructions for AI
When this document is selected:
1. [Specific instruction 1]
2. [Specific instruction 2]

## Examples
[Add relevant examples if needed]
```

### 5. AI Context System Rules
Created two important files:
- `cursor-context-system-rules.md` - Comprehensive rules for AI behavior
- `recommended-cursor-rule.md` - Simple rule to add to .cursorrules

### 6. Improved Workflow
1. **Organize** contexts into logical folders (azure/, testing/, architecture/)
2. **Create** specific context documents for different scenarios
3. **Select** relevant contexts by ticking checkboxes
4. **AI follows** the instructions in selected context documents

## Technical Implementation

### Dashboard Changes
- Added `contextFolderStructure` state to track folder hierarchy
- Implemented recursive folder building with `buildContextFolderStructure()`
- Created `flattenContextFiles()` to maintain compatibility
- Added new message handlers for folder/file creation

### UI Enhancements
- New CSS classes for folder tree visualization
- Hover effects for action buttons
- Responsive layout maintained
- Clean, VSCode-themed design

### File System Operations
- Safe folder creation with `fs.mkdirSync({ recursive: true })`
- Template-based document creation
- Automatic file opening after creation
- Error handling for all operations

## Benefits Over Previous System

1. **No more context-referer.mdc** - Replaced with simple, direct selection
2. **Organized structure** - Contexts grouped logically in folders
3. **Easy management** - Create/edit contexts directly from dashboard
4. **Flexible rules** - Each context document can define its own AI behavior
5. **Visual clarity** - See your entire context structure at a glance

## Migration Path

1. Move `context-referer.mdc` to `ProjectSpecificContextFiles/context-referer.md`
2. Make it an optional tick like any other context
3. Add the recommended rule to `.cursorrules`
4. Organize existing contexts into logical folders
5. Create new context documents as needed

## Usage Example

```
ProjectSpecificContextFiles/
├── cursor-context-system-rules.md ✓ (always follow these)
├── azure/
│   ├── azure-devops-context.md ✓ (tick when working with Azure)
│   └── azure-ticket-workflow.md
├── development/
│   ├── developer-roles-context.md ✓ (tick for role-based development)
│   └── coding-standards.md
└── testing/
    └── unit-testing-guidelines.md ✓ (tick when writing tests)
```

The AI will read and follow ONLY the ticked documents, making it much more efficient than the previous semantic detection system.
