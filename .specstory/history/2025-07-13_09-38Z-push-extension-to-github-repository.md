I'll help you push your extension to GitHub. First, let me check the context-referer file to understand the proper approach for this request.

Could not find file '.cursor/rules/context-referer.mdc' in the workspace.

Let me check if there's a context-referer file in the workspace:

No results found
</details>

Let me check the current directory structure to understand the project better:
